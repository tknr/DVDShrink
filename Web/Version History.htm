<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added Quality Settings tab in
the backup dialog, with option to enable AEC &quot;adaptive error
compensation&quot; algorithms.</font></p>

includes support for burning DVD-9 dual-layer media. Added DVD-9
target size in preferences window.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed &quot;burn with DVD
Decrypter&quot; checkbox and replaced with a selectable backup
target.</font></p>

backup target, this appears if CopyToDVD is installed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added automatic support for
splitting ISO files if they are saved to a FAT32 partition. In

Decrypter and mounted by Daemon Tools. MDS files can additionally
be opened with DVD Shrink from the &quot;Open Disc Image...&quot;
menu.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added support for replacing a
title with a custom image. A default image from Guy Incognito is

&quot;Backup Target&quot; dialog.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed file opening code to work

files stored in the VIDEO_TS folder of a CD-ROM disc.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved support for mousewheel
in DVD browser view.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Backup proceeds without warning
if total compilation size is within 128KB of the target size.
This helps prevent warnings if automatic compression is slightly
inaccurate (due to floating point rounding error).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added menu option to turn on/off
&quot;combine shared titles&quot; in full-disc mode.</font></p>

available burning devices.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug where analysis results
file could be saved to the wrong filename after &quot;deep

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed &quot;no default
audio&quot; and &quot;no default subpicture&quot; options in

could still be forced on.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Increased maximum compression to
same level as 3.0b5.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug which prevented
opening of individual IFO files (can do this by dropping IFO file
into DVD Shrink main window, use with caution because unless you
open a VIDEO_TS.IFO file the output will not be a complete DVD).</font></p>

Jan 2004</strong></font></p>

remapped).</font></p>

remapping&quot; is unchecked by default.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug where non-logical
stream remapping would fail to zero completely the disabled
stream in PGC_GI tables.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Mixed
Compression&quot; entry to the video compression box which is
purely for information, better than displaying a blank entry.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 3.1 Beta 8 - 8
Jan 2004</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Burn dialog automatically steps
progress control when in &quot;waiting for insert media&quot;
mode: try to create the impression that we have not crashed, but
are waiting...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wrapped NeroAPI code in
exception handlers: if a crash occurs within Nero, then DVD
Shrink should be able to continue (without burning
functionality).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved checking of target
folder validity. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved handling of scenario

material: user is prompted to insert blank media after encoding
and replace original disc after burning.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Logical remapping of
enabled streams&quot; option. This is checked by default. If
checked, all disabled streams are entirely removed from IFO
files, and menu buttons, navigation commands are remapped to
point to the correct remaining streams. If unchecked, disabled
streams are only marked as unavailable in PGC_GI tables, and no
remapping of any kind occurs. The first (default checked) option
is generally recommended, but may cause problems with stream
selection on some discs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 3.1 Beta 7 - 7

dialog, so it starts at an offset depending how much of the DVD
has already been analysed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If error occurs during Nero
initialization (demo version expired, etc) then burning is
disabled and backup dialog displays hyperlink to
http://www.nero.com instead. Backup to hard disk will function
normally.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Append &quot;.nrg&quot;
extension if user doesn't type one when saving an image file.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added property page for burn
settings if burning is enabled </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 3.1 Beta 6 - 6

Burning is enabled if you have nero 6 installed. It may also work
with Nero version 5, not yet tested.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changed &quot;finished&quot;
dialog to handle the various states.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added hyperlink to finished
dialog, opens windows explorer at the output file folder.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changed DVD opening code to
allow open of partial (incomplete) DVD folders in re-author mode.

DVD from invalid media.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Increased shutdown time to 120

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deep analysis before backup is
unchecked by default.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decreased time to wait for state
change in preview window to 100ms which can improve response when
selection changes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added device-removal handling.
It is now impossible to re-author a title from an ejected disk,
or edit an ejected disk in full-disk mode (the document closes).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added F5 refresh shortcut. DVD
browser should automatically refresh if a disk is inserted or
removed (but volume label does not always display correctly until
manually refreshed).</font></p>

preserved if you switch away from re-author mode (it will still

Data\DVD Shrink. This folder is version independent and will not
change in future releases of DVD Shrink.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changed DeCSS disk reader to use
overlapped IO on WinNT systems, this may (or may not) increase
performance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 3.1 Beta 4 - 3

Dec 2003</strong></font></p>

Aug 2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed VTS address offsets in
TT_SRPT for re-authored disks with more than one title. This will

prevented playback of the second title, depending on player.</font></p>

Aug 2003</strong></font></p>

Aug 2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed problem with mapping audio
and subpicture stream numbers in re-author mode.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed crash when cancelling
quick analysis after opening DVD Shrink by command-line or by
clicking on IFO file in Explorer. Now exits gracefully (since

- Automatic - DVD Shrink will choose the best compression ratio.<br>
- Custom - you can select desired ratio (with a slider)<br>
- Still Pictures - as before.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Better quick analysis. The
sample points for initial quick analysis are carefully chosen,
and sparse analysis results are interpolated between samples.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New &quot;Analysis&quot;
button.This performs a deep analysis, which (a) guarantees that
the predicted target size is met and (b) significantly improves
video quality.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New &quot;Analysis Results&quot;
file format. More flexible, used to save results of the initial
quick analysis, also deep analysis results or partial analysis
results (if you cancel analysis, partial results are saved). Also
better checking in case of conflict of CRC values between two
DVDs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One-pass encoding. Output files
are written to HD in one pass, so no longer necessary to make a
second pass to fix navigation ptrs. This reduces total encode
time by about 5 mins.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Multi-threaded preload buffer
(in both analysis and encode modules). While one batch of data is
being processed, the next batch is pre-loaded on a seperate
thread. This seems to work especially well during quick analysis,
where the waiting time for drive seek operations is significantly
reduced.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">RCE region protection removal,
special thanks to Mr.Bass. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New &quot;New Frame&quot; menu
option - creates another instance of DVD Shrink, but in the same
process. This is used by re-author module which now supports drag
'n drop, or cut &amp; paste, from any window (re-author from
multiple disks).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Video preview window shifted to
the right-pane, which is where it belongs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed various strange behaviours
in the DVD and Streams View. Also removed the
&quot;Compressed&quot; column, since takes up unnecessary space.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Compression % values inverted,
so they now represent the ratio of output size to original (small
% = big compression).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">File reading code now supports
output from DVD Decryptor in &quot;Auto&quot; file-splitting
mode, or non-split VOB files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug in re-author where
only 32 titles could be played in sequence. The limit now is 99.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;perform deep
analysis&quot; option in backup dialog, thus analysis and
re-encode become one sequential operation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;shutdown when
complete&quot; option in backup dialog.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;remove
macrovision&quot; option in preferences (all versions since 2.x
have removed macrovision, now it is an option).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;remove P-UOPs&quot;
option in preferences.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;split VOB
files&quot; option in preferences, on by default.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed possible problem which may
have caused gaps in audio playback.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed option to disable menu
subpicture streams, as this stream usually contains the menu
buttons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added option to completely
disable video preview.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moved all hard coded text
strings into resource file, so future translations will be
complete.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed &quot;view Raw DVD&quot;
option.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Unreferenced
Material&quot; folder, which appears in the main view if material
is found on the dvd which does not seem to belong to any menu or
title. Previously the existance of this material would cause
errors in target size calculations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed &quot;error margin&quot;
option - no longer required ;-)</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Combine Shared
Titles&quot; menu option, which is on by default. Turn this off
to seperately list all multi-angle titles (or titles which share
the same video with other titles) in the main view. You will need
this, for instance, if you wish to re-author only Angle 2.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed TMAP table generation for
re-authored titles with angle greater than 1. Seek in PowerDVD
etc should now work, whatever the angle.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Various other tweaks and
enhancements.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 2.3 - 14 June
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug in re-author module
which occurred in certain DVDs with a strange PGC structure. This
bug caused dvd player to freeze or lockup at specific points in
the movie.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added support for 64bit file
sizes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added support for opening files
generated by IFOEdit software.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug which caused analysis
to crash if input video stream is corrupt.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Attempt to make &quot;Remapping
VOBS&quot; stage more reliable, even if there are errors on
original DVD.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added automatic
&quot;retry&quot; (4 retries) if read from disk fails.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed error in .IFO file output:
vtsi_mat_ea, vts_tmapt_ea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug where video could be
corrupted in some rare situations (vobu containing more than one
sequence header).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tweaked video encoder module,
now slightly faster.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug in &quot;Still
Pictures&quot; mode, picture temporal reference is now set
correctly, and sequence end code is always written.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Total Processing
Time&quot; information to finish dialog.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added support in
&quot;Preferences&quot; for combining titles which overlap or
share the same video in the DVD View. This prevents confusion
where a compression level applied to one title also affects
another, because they share the same video.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 2.2 - 11 June
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug where fast
forward/fast backward playback did not function correctly in
target disk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 2.1 - 11 June
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved compression and new
levels. The quality is much improved.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added unicode support for
Japanese language. Japanese release is unicode, all other
languages are MBCS since unicode doesn't work on Windows 98.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hide audio/subpicture streams of
negligible size is turned off by default. Also fixed filtering
bug in Streams View.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed bug where &quot;Still
Pictures&quot; mode failed while encoding menus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 2.0 - 6 June
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New User Interface.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved compression algorithms.
This version is slower than 1.03, but the achieved compression
ratio is greater at any encode level.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Various issues about jerky
playback and video corruption have been fixed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Macrovision is removed from the
VOB files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">RCE region protection is NOT
removed (yet). This can prevent full-disk backup of RCE protected
disks, however re-author mode will work of course. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decryption module rewritten from
scratch, and no longer contains GNU libdvdcss library code.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Multi-angle problems fixed, so
you can add any angle in re-author mode, no more &quot;no cell
pieces in this angle&quot; error. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">NTSC/PAL mixup is fixed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Invalid BCD::tc_flag error is
fixed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed code which remapped
remaining audio/subpicture stream IDs if any were removed. This
caused problems on some DVDs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lots of other small fixes, all
of which I can't remember now.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 1.04 - 21 April
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed multi-angle in re-author.
The only limitation now is you cannot select ALL angles
simultaneously.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed crash in re-author if
TMAPT (time map table) is not present.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed %compression display
during re-encoding, since it served no function other than to
confuse.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed DirectDraw bug where
copier/encoder would crash due to loss of display surface (when
screen saver starts, etc).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Modified output stream of
encoder, now removes CRC and PES_EXT, and sets/unsets various
flags in the PES headers. Still not entirely sure if PES_EXT is
compulsory for the first VOBU in a VOB.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changed &quot;Browse for
Folder&quot; to modal dialog.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed rather serious bug in
&quot;Crop&quot; where selection by chapter was incorrectly
offset by one vobu - why did nobody report this...?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;region-free&quot;
control in set target dialog, this is always on by default.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Macrovision is now removed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed libdvdcss because of GNU
licensing issues. Current decryption module only supports Win
NT/2K/XP.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Various other fixes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 1.03 - 9 April
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added extra encode levels. This
is not a final solution to the encode interface, just a temporary
measure.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added &quot;Still Movie&quot;
encoding: only copy the I-pictures, heavily compressed. This
gives huge compression as an alternative to deletion of the
entire video stream, which people seem to want, but re-encoder
module can't handle, because it alters the navigation structure
of the DVD. Audio and subpicture streams will still play
normally. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Increased number of samples
taken during analysis, so it takes 50% longer but gives more
accurate expected sizes. Maybe this should be a user option.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;not a system
pack&quot; error is fixed, by removing non-system packs during
the re-encode, rather than throwing an error. I still don't know
what these non-system packs are doing in the VOBS, or if they
shouldn't be included instead. If they occur, a little message
pops up after re-encode is finished.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Increased brightness of video
preview in re-author module, add and crop dialogs. Preview
windows in other modules are DirectDraw YUV surfaces for
performance, so not so easy to modify.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Removed support for multi-angle
from re-author. Too many problems. Adding support again will
require a virtual rewrite of the re-author module. User is now
offered only angle 1, which will prevent crashes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added a message next to
&quot;include menus&quot; checkbox in re-author, so hopefully
people will stop thinking they can include menus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added code to strip all buttons
and button commands from menus that are added in re-author,
actually from anything that is added at all. Most of them contain
invalid links or commands, esp. in the case of menu vobs because
they move from the menu domain to the VTS domain when the
re-authored DVD is built. I guess no buttons is better than
invalid buttons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixed stupid bug where region
and provider ID changes were written to the .IFO files but not
the .BUP files, so they came out different.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Modified error reporting dialog.
Now attempts to report the cause of an error using GetLastError()
API.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Added check that source and
destination folders are different. Not entirely foolproof because
of shortcuts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just to make sure,
encoding/copying will not proceed unless the destination folder
is empty of DVD files.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changed distribution name. From
now on, DVDShrink103.exe, etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><strong>Version 1.02 - 7 April
2003</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Initial Release</font></p>
